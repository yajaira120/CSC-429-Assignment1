    "#### The differences between BFS and DFS are with the traversal order, the BFS and DFS both have similar results but they actually go in different order. In BFS, they explore the grid level by level, so it visits the neighbors to find the path to find B. In DFS, it will find the path by going as deep as possible but if it reaches a dead end it will backtrack. For path length, BFS will try to find the shortest path so the shortest path from A to B is (6,0), (6,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3). For DFS, it will just return the first path it finds, which depends on the traversal order, so it ends up with a much longer path, starting from (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). As for memory usage, BFS stores the nodes in the queue at once so if it is a large grid, BFS can use a lot of memory, and for DFS it will only store the current path so its more efficient than BFS. "
